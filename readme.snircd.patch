-     channel are squelched. A user will be 'invisible' in the channel
-     from other users until they speak, are opped/voiced or change the
-     topic. When the +D mode is cleared, 'invisible' users will not be

- * Command /check
-     Allows opers to see information about a channel, user or server.
-     Syntax: Check Channel: /check <#channel> [-i|-o|-u]

+             Check Server:  /CHECK <server>
+             Check User:    /CHECK <nick!user@host> [-<flags>]
 
-     Performing a /check on a server returns its status:
+     flags:
+     -c  Show channels the user is on (mask)
+     -i  Show IP instead of host (channel, mask)
+     -l  show oplevel (channel)

- * Sethost allows opers (and users w/ passwords) to set their hostname,
-   also known as spoofing. Sethost is configured from the config file via
-   S: lines and several F: lines. Sethost is done through the /sethost
-   command or by setting user mode +h. Available Sethosts are visible by
-   using the /stats s command.
-   Syntax: Oper Sethost: /sethost <new ident> <new hostname>
-                         /mode <nick> +h <new ident>@<new hostname>
-           User Sethost: /sethost <new hostname> <password>

+ * SETHOST: Sethost allows opers (and users w/ passwords) to set their hostname,
+            also known as spoofing. Sethost is configured from the config file via
+            Spoof blocks and several features. Sethost is done through the /SETHOST
+            command or by setting usermode +h. Only opers are allowed to remove their sethost.
+            Available Sethosts are visible by using the /STATS s|spoofhosts command.
 
- * Single letter nicks are protected for use by network services only.

+            Remove Sethost: /SETHOST undo
+                            /MODE <nick> -h
 
- * Protection from net rider's joining +i/+k channels after a net.join.
+ * REMOTESETHOST: Allow a server with a Uworld block to remotely set a sethost on a user.
+                  P10 syntax "<source server numeric> SH <target user numeric> <spoof user> <spoof host>"
+                  The SH command travels from source server to the server of the target user,
+                  from there a normal usermode change is broadcasted.
 
- * Topics can by sent during bursts to keep them synced throughout a network.
+ * IAUTHSETHOST:  Allows the iauth daemon to set hosts for new users with the H message.
 
- * Ability to Gline a nick, new format now nick!ident@host.
+ * GLINE: Ability to Gline a nick, new format now nick!user@host.
+          Changing nick and Gline matches the newnick!user@host,
+          the change is refused for erroneous nick error.
+          Remotely set local glines are flagged as global,
+          used by services to sync glines with no lastmod to servers,
+          as these glines are not part of the netburst.
+          Gline reasons are removed from the quit message shown to other users,
+          including the quit messages by remote users.
 
- * /stats C & H show full details for Opers.
+ * BADCHAN: Ability to use wildcards in BADCHANs (Glines on a channel)
+            to deny access to channel names matching the badchan.
+            When a badchan is placed, users on the channel(s) affected
+            are kicked from the channel by their server.
 
- * Ability to restart the resolver via /rehash and /DNS r.
+ * USERHOST/USERIP: Show real host and IP to opers.
 
- * Ability for services to send BURST outside of net.burst.
+ * OPLEVELS: Oplevels below 100 (0-99) are only setable by a service (define MINOPLEVEL).
+             Known issue: restriction applies to server modes too,
+             causing a desynch in oplevels when modes are bounced (HACK3).
 
-- configuration file options ------------------------------------------------
+ * MODE: Disallow ordinary users to see the banlist (/MODE #chan b)
+         when they are not on the channel.
 
-S: Sethost Lines 
- Syntax:  S:<spoof host>:<password>:<*.host.cc|a.b.c.*|CIDR>:<ident>
- Example: S:moo.fish.moo:elitepassword:host.example.com:user
+ * SNOMASK: Default snomask for opers changed, removed SNO_HACK4.
 
- This adds the sethost 'moo.fish.moo' that can be activated by a user by using
- the password 'elitepassword' and will automatically be applied to anyone
- connecting from 'host.example.com' with the ident 'user'.
+ * OPER: Opers cannot excess flood
+         Opers rate limited to 1 command per 1 second (instead 1 command of per 2 seconds)
+         Opers always have a free target
 
- More Examples:
-   Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo'
-          S:moo.fish.moo:::
-   User & Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo'
-          S:moo.fish.moo:elitepassword::
-   Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo' with auto on 'ident@*.example.com"
-          S:moo.fish.moo::*.example.com:ident
+ * TOPICLEN: Define for TOPICLEN changed from 160 to 250.
 
-F:SETHOST
+ * FREETARGETS: Start free targets changed from 10 to 20.
+
+ * BADUSER: Rules for a bad username relaxed.
+
+ * JOIN: Changed error message when joining channels, numeric replies:
+         471 ERR_CHANNELISFULL  "Cannot join channel, channel is full (+l)"
+         473 ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN "Cannot join channel, you must be invited (+i)"
+         474 ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN "Cannot join channel, you are banned (+b)"
+         475 ERR_BADCHANNELKEY  "Cannot join channel, you need the correct key (+k)"
+         477 ERR_NEEDREGGEDNICK "Cannot join channel (+r): 
+                                 this channel requires authentication --
+                                 For details of how to obtain an account visit <url>"
+         479 ERR_BADCHANNAME    "Cannot join channel (G-lined: <reason>)"
+
+ * ACCOUNT: Parameter account ID added to ACCOUNT command and usermode +r param.
+            Account timestamp and id are allowed to be set, even when the user has an account set already,
+            provided the account set on the user and the account in the AC message are the same,
+            and no account timestamp and id are set. The timestamp can be used to identify the session,
+            and ID can be used to identify the account. Accounts expire and account names
+            are reused, account IDs are not and can be used to unique identify a user.
+            P10 syntax "<source server numeric> AC <target user numeric> <account> [<timestamp> [<ID>]]
+                       "+r <account>[:<timestamp>[:<ID>]]" in N (NICK) message introducing the user
+
+ * ACCOUNTLEN: ACCOUNTLEN increased from 12 to 15 (define ACCOUNTLEN).
+
+ * WHOIS: Changed numeric reply 330 RPL_WHOISACCOUNT text from "is logged in as" to "is authed as".
+
+ * HASH: Disallow ordinary users using /HASH.
+
+ * SERVER: Added server flag n (send oper names), usermode +o has the opername (used to /OPER) as parameter.
+           A server linking with flag n is expected to send and parse opername as parameter to usermode +o.
+           Max length of an opername is 15 (define ACCOUNTLEN).
+           A "-" char (define NOPERNAMECHARACTER) is used as opername when a server does not send them.
+           A service can use this char as opername as well, since opernames for a service have little meaning.
+           Added numeric reply 343 RPL_WHOISOPERNAME "<nick> :is opered as", shown to opers in /WHOIS.
+
+ * REHASH: Do not check for G-lines during a rehash, only K-lines.
+
+ * WEBIRC: Sends webirc arguments to the iauth daemon if there is one.
